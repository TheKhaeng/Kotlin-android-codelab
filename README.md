## 「 Usage 」

```git

```

open this project and run :)


## 「 Code lab 」

This code lab contains examples for testing Kotlin language, you can try
different scenarios and check the results. We believe that this way will help
you understand the code more than just reading, and it will reduce the learning curve.
To do it, open
[reference to the Kotlin language](https://www.kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/)
and try it in this code lab.

## 「 Lecture 」
So this codelab we follow the doc reference at [kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/](https://www.kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/)

![lecture](./KotlinCodelab/picture/lecture.png)

The class represents the lecture topic, there are two main parts in each class:

1. **Lecture section**: a sample code for each lecture.
2. **Try section**: there's example code in this section already, you can modify and play with it
result message will be displayed in logcat.

}
```
